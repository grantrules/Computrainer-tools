tools I wrote to make life at the bike shop easier

gra.py is a study assistant that'll make it easy to pass your giant retail academy exams!

These two are for Computrainer Multirider:

compugen.py creates a random course with slopes that don't make the computrainer go crazy

gpx2crs.py generates a multirider course from a gpx (from a garmin or exported from a site)
 - applies a smoothing algorithm. computrainers did not respond well to constant grade changes.
