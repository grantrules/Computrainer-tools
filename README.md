# Computrainer-tools
tools I wrote to make life with multirider easier

compugen.py creates a random course with slopes that don't make the computrainer go crazy

gpx2crs.py generates a multirider course from a gpx (from a garmin or exported from a site)
 - applies a smoothing algorithm. computrainers did not respond well to constant grade changes.
